# Statistics

This repository contains four projects focusing on statistical concepts and statistical models, particularly in probability, risk analysis, and regression modelling.

## 1. LLN and CLT (Law of Large Numbers & Central Limit Theorem)

Concepts:

Demonstrates how the Law of Large Numbers (LLN) ensures that sample averages converge to the population mean as sample size increases.
Shows how the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) allows non-normally distributed variables to approximate a normal distribution when aggregated.

## 2. Monte Carlo Simulation

Concepts:

Introduces the Monte Carlo method for probabilistic risk analysis and numerical approximation.
Explores random sampling techniques to solve problems that may be difficult to compute deterministically.

Simple examples:

- Estimation of π (Pi) using Monte Carlo methods.
- Project risk analysis using cost uncertainty simulations.
- Construction Budget vs Cost Risk Analysis
- Demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem using MC simulation (using an engineering example)

## 3. Logistic Regression Model

Introduction:

focused on binary classification using Logistic Regression.
Discusses model interpretation, evaluation metrics, and decision boundary visualization.

## 4. Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)

Introduction:

An extension of linear regression that accommodates non-normal response variables.
Covers different distributions such as Poisson (count data), Binomial (classification), and Gamma (skewed data). (To be continued..)

🛠 Case studies:

- Leukemia Remission
- Youtube Spam classification
